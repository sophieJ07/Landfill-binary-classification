# Landfill-binary-classification
A deep learning binary classification model that effectively identifying the presence or absence of landfill in aerial images. Created for the [2023-2024 National Big Data And AI Challenge For High School Students.](https://www.stemfellowship.org/case-study/2023-2024-national-big-data-and-ai-challenge-for-school-students/)

### Dataset 
[AerialWaste](https://zenodo.org/records/7034382) (by Rocio Nahime Torresby and Piero Fraternali) was an aerial image dataset curated for the purpose of detecting illegal landfills. The dataset comprises a total of 10,977 images sourced from: 
1. The AGEA: Orthophotos generated through an airborne campaign executed by AGEA.
2. WorldView3: High-resolution RGB images acquired from a commercial satellite sensor.
3. Google Earth: RGB images obtained using the Google API.

Of the full dataset, 90% were used for training the model developed below and 10% for testing.
